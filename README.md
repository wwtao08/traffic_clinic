Applying the LLM, based on the historical/real-time trajectory data input of the road network, we get
(1) Evaluation of the flow and traffic situation awareness of regional roads, and automatic generation of traffic condition assessment reports
(2) Determination of accident points and congestion points, and analysis of the causes of abnormal traffic scenarios.
(3) Real-time control strategy generation, including signal timing program, road closure, speed limit, police, etc.

Partially replace the traditional traffic police manual judgment and decision-making, based on LLM to assist the traffic control agency, improve the scientific and real-time decision-making
